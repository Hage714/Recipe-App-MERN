        <h5>3. Disclaimer</h5>
        <p>
          Software is provided on an "AS IS" basis, without warranty of any
          kind, including without limitation the warranties of merchantability,
          fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. The entire risk
          as to the quality and performance of the Software is borne by you.

          entire cost of any service and repair. In no event shall the creators,
          contributors, or providers be liable for any direct, indirect,
          incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages including,
          but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services; loss
          of use, data, or profits; or business Contrubtions and/or donations do
          not guarantee service, or represent any agreement or contract. Perks

          damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or
          profit, or due to business interruption), even if ThisRecipe or a
          ThisRecipe authorized representative has been notified orally or in
          writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions
          do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of

          may not apply to you.
